<p>1. The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 by the Māori chiefs and the British Crown is considered a turning point in South Island history. The treaty's relevance extends beyond its historical setting as it aimed to provide a framework for respectful and peaceful coexistence.</p>

<p> 2. Disparities between the Māori and English versions, however, planted the seeds of distrust and struggles, resulting in land conflicts and the fall of Māori culture.</p>

The cooperation and protection tenets of the treaty continue to be essential to New Zealand's legal framework and cultural norms but in spite of these obstacles.</p> <p>The Waitangi Tribunal's formation demonstrates the country's dedication to adressing historical wrongs and promoting peace.</p>
